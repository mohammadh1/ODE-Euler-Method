# ODE-Euler-Method
The Euler method is a numerical approach for solving ODEs by approximating the solution in discrete steps. A Python program is provided for implementation.

The Euler method is a fundamental numerical procedure used in mathematics and computational science for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with an initial value. As a first-order explicit method, it is considered the simplest form of the Runge-Kutta method. This method involves breaking down the ODE into discrete steps and approximating the solution at each step based on the previous value. 
In this article, we delve into a comprehensive exploration of the Euler method. We discuss its mathematical foundations and properties, such as its first-order nature, and examine the relationship between step size and error. Furthermore, we provide a detailed explanation of the algorithm and present a computer program that can effectively solve differential equations using this method. 
By understanding and implementing the Euler method, researchers and practitioners in various fields can efficiently tackle ODEs numerically. This article serves as a valuable resource for programmers and mathematicians seeking to apply this method in their computational analyses and simulations.
